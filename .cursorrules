# Cursor Rules for Proactive MCP Tool Usage

## Core Principle

Always proactively use available MCP tools when they can help with the current task. Don't wait for explicit requests - if a tool is relevant, use it automatically.

## Available MCP Tools

### Discord Tools (via mcp-discord)

- **When to use**: Any task involving Discord servers, channels, messages, events, or roles
- **Proactive triggers**:
  - User mentions Discord, server, channel, message, event, role
  - Code references Discord API or discord.py
  - User asks about server management, moderation, or automation
  - Creating scheduled events or managing Discord communities

### Linear Tools (via linear MCP server)

- **When to use**: Any task involving project management, issue tracking, or task organization
- **Proactive triggers**:
  - User mentions bug, issue, feature, task, todo
  - Code contains TODO, FIXME, BUG comments
  - User asks about project status or planning
  - Creating or updating issues related to code changes
  - Linking code changes to Linear issues automatically

### Context7 Tools (via context7 MCP server)

- **When to use**: Any task requiring documentation, examples, or library information
- **Proactive triggers**:
  - User asks "how do I...", "show me...", "what is...", "examples of..."
  - Code uses unfamiliar libraries or APIs
  - User requests documentation or examples
  - Implementing features using new libraries
  - Debugging issues with third-party libraries

### Notion Tools (via mcp-code-execution → notion)

- **When to use**: Any task involving documentation, knowledge base, or project notes
- **Proactive triggers**:
  - User mentions documentation, notes, wiki, knowledge base
  - Creating or updating project documentation
  - Storing code examples or patterns
  - Organizing project information

### YouTube Tools (via mcp-code-execution → youtube)

- **When to use**: Research, learning, or finding video content
- **Proactive triggers**:
  - User asks about tutorials, videos, or learning resources
  - Researching topics or technologies
  - Finding examples or demonstrations

### Web Scraping Tools (via mcp-code-execution → crawl4ai)

- **When to use**: Extracting information from websites or web research
- **Proactive triggers**:
  - User mentions website, scraping, crawling, extracting
  - Need to gather information from web sources
  - Researching competitors or similar projects

## Automatic Workflow Patterns

### 1. Code Review → Linear Issue Creation

When reviewing code and finding bugs or issues:

1. Automatically check if a Linear issue exists for this problem
2. If not, create a Linear issue with:
   - Bug description from code context
   - File and line references
   - Suggested fix approach
   - Link to the code location

### 2. Implementation → Documentation Lookup

When implementing features:

1. Automatically fetch Context7 docs for libraries being used
2. Search for examples and best practices
3. Reference documentation in code comments
4. Update Notion docs with implementation details

### 3. Bug Fix → Discord Notification

When fixing critical bugs:

1. Check if Discord server has relevant channels
2. Optionally notify team via Discord (if configured)
3. Create or update Linear issue
4. Document fix in Notion

### 4. Feature Development → Full Workflow

When developing new features:

1. **Planning**: Create Linear issue with feature description
2. **Research**: Use Context7 to find relevant documentation and examples
3. **Implementation**: Use web scraping if needed for research
4. **Documentation**: Update Notion with implementation details
5. **Communication**: Use Discord to coordinate if needed

### 5. Learning & Research → Multi-Tool

When user asks questions or needs to learn:

1. Use Context7 to get up-to-date documentation
2. Use YouTube tools to find video tutorials
3. Use web scraping to gather additional resources
4. Store findings in Notion for future reference

## Tool Selection Strategy

1. **Always check MCP tools first** before suggesting manual steps
2. **Use multiple tools in sequence** when they complement each other
3. **Cache results** - if you've fetched docs/examples, reference them in responses
4. **Link related information** - connect Linear issues, Notion docs, and code

## Examples of Proactive Usage

### Example 1: User writes "I need to add error handling"

**Automatic actions:**

1. Use Context7 to get error handling best practices for the language/framework
2. Check Linear for existing issues about error handling
3. Provide code examples from Context7
4. Suggest creating a Linear issue to track this improvement

### Example 2: User mentions a bug

**Automatic actions:**

1. Search Linear for existing issues about this bug
2. If found, link to it and update with current context
3. If not found, offer to create a Linear issue
4. Use Context7 to find debugging techniques
5. Check Discord for related discussions

### Example 3: User asks "How do I use FastMCP?"

**Automatic actions:**

1. Use Context7 to fetch FastMCP documentation
2. Search for code examples
3. Check if there are YouTube tutorials
4. Store useful examples in Notion for future reference

### Example 4: User creates a new feature

**Automatic actions:**

1. Offer to create a Linear issue for tracking
2. Use Context7 to research best practices
3. Check for similar implementations in the codebase
4. Update Notion with feature documentation

## Memory Integration

- **Store in memories**: Tool usage patterns, frequently accessed docs, common Linear issues
- **Reference memories**: When similar tasks come up, check memories first
- **Update memories**: When you learn new patterns or find useful resources

## Tool Discovery

When unsure which tool to use:

1. List available MCP tools using `discovered_servers()`
2. Query tool docs using `query_tool_docs(server, tool)`
3. Search tools using `search_tool_docs(query)`
4. Create tool proxies and test them

## Best Practices

1. **Be proactive, not intrusive**: Use tools when helpful, but don't overwhelm
2. **Explain tool usage**: When using a tool, briefly mention what you're doing
3. **Handle failures gracefully**: If a tool fails, suggest alternatives
4. **Combine tools intelligently**: Use multiple tools when they provide complementary information
5. **Learn from context**: Remember which tools were useful for similar tasks

## Special Instructions

- **For code changes**: Always check if related Linear issues exist
- **For new libraries**: Always fetch Context7 docs before implementation
- **For bugs**: Always create or update Linear issues
- **For research**: Use multiple tools (Context7, YouTube, web scraping)
- **For documentation**: Store in Notion for team access

## Tool Priority

When multiple tools could help:

1. **Context7** for documentation and examples (fastest, most reliable)
2. **Linear** for project management and tracking
3. **Discord** for team communication
4. **Notion** for knowledge storage
5. **YouTube/Web scraping** for research

Remember: The goal is to make development smoother by automatically using tools that can help, not to wait for explicit requests.
